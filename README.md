### Hi there 👋

I am a Oracle DBA and IT specialist with a wide range of interests. I do not only deal with Oracle, but also with automation, programming, other databases and data analysis. 

I successfully completed the [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) Nanodegrees **Data Analysis** and **Machine Learning Engineer**. Please find my submissions in the corresponding repositories here at GitHub.

The topics and products I am currently dealing with and interested in:

- Automation
  - [Packer](https://www.packer.io/)
  - [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
  - [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
  - [Saltstack](https://saltproject.io/)
- Database
  - [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com)
  - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
  - [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- Programming
  - [Raku](https://raku.org/) *the artist formerly known as Perl* 😁
  - [Julia](https://julialang.org/)
  - SQL (and Oracle PL/SQL)

Of course, I cannot be an expert on all of these subjects.
Nevertheless, I work with all of them every now and then.
