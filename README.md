### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Oracle DBA and IT specialist with a wide range of interests. I do not only deal with Oracle, but also with automation, programming, and data analysis. 

I successfully completed the [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) Nanodegrees **Data Analysis** and **Machine Learning Engineer**. Please find my submissions in the corresponding repositories here at GitHub.

The topics and products I am currently dealing with and interested in:

- Automation
  - [Packer](https://www.packer.io/)
  - [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
  - [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
  - [Saltstack](https://saltproject.io/)
- [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/)
  - [High Availability](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/high-availability.html)
  - [Security](https://www.oracle.com/security/database-security/)
  - [Data Analysis and VLDB](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/datawarehouse-bigdata.html)
  - [Machine Learning](https://www.oracle.com/machine-learning)
- Programming
  - [Python](https://www.python.org/) including Data Analysis packages like pandas, cupy etc.
  - SQL (and Oracle PL/SQL)
  - Javascript (for my website that is build using 11ty)

Of course, I cannot be an expert on all of these subjects.
Nevertheless, I work with all of them every now and then.
